* Semigroup
The semigroup [[id:479ebd3d-f89d-45b3-894b-494905524c2f][type class]] describes a type that has a commutative binary
operation called ~append~. In PureScript, it's defined as:

#+begin_src purescript
class Semigroup a where
  append :: a → a → a
#+end_src

** Common Semigroup Instances

*** Additive
Additive is a [[id:0b88319b-63f7-49c1-930a-76111044bc95][newtype wrapper]] over ~Int~ that provides addition for its
instance's ~append~ operation.

#+begin_src purescript
newtype Additive = Additive Int

instance Semigroup Additive where
  append (Additive a) (Additive b) = Additive (a + b)
#+end_src

*** List
#+begin_src purescript
data List a = Cons a (List a) | Nil

instance Semigroup (List a) where
  append xs Nil = xs
  append Nil ys = ys
  append (Cons x xs) ys = Cons x (append xs ys)
#+end_src
