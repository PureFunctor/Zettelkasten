* Associativity
Associativity is a mathematical concept related to how operations are
grouped together when written in sequence.

** Left Assoc.
A left-associative operator prioritizes grouping terms to the
left. Examples of such operators are subtraction and division:

#+begin_src purescript
5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 → (((5 - 4) - 3) - 2) - 1
#+end_src

** Right Assoc.
A right-associative operator prioritizes grouping terms to the
right. Examples of such operators is exponentiation:

#+begin_src purescript
1 ^ 2 ^ 3 → 1 ^ (2 ^ 3)
#+end_src

** In Relation to Folds
[[id:b991c869-317b-4066-885c-431943175554][Folds]] typically make use of associativity by providing variants that
allow one to specify the associativity of the operator being passed.

For example, the ~foldl~ function is left-associative, while the ~foldr~
function is right-associative.
