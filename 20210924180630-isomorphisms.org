* Isomorphisms
We typically say that there exists an isomorphism between two things if
there exists an "invertible" [[id:a853c555-bcef-48dd-8eee-f70aeb6c33dc][morphism]] i.e. we can go from one thing to
another and vice versa.

A concrete example of an isomorphism would be [[id:a603d7e4-d9a5-4d0f-a7a3-13c939200c2a][newtypes]], which at
runtime, have the same representation as the term they're wrapping.

The PureScript compiler provides the [[id:c4317425-5316-486f-8b79-70df22ea5dcd][Coercible]] [[id:479ebd3d-f89d-45b3-894b-494905524c2f][type class]] for
compiler-resolved isomorphisms between types.
