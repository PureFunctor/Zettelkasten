* Type Synonym
A type synonym is exactly what it sounds like. It allows one to define
an alias for an otherwise redundant type to improve readability of code.

Type synonyms are also expanded at compile-time, and as such, incur
zero runtime costs much like [[id:a603d7e4-d9a5-4d0f-a7a3-13c939200c2a][newtypes]].

#+begin_src purescript
type LongType = Array (Either { l :: Int } { r :: Number })
