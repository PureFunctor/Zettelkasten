* Fleeting Thoughts

This repository contains zettelkasten-style notes that I've composed using Org Roam. I mostly use
this to write about functional programming and other fleeting thoughts that come to my mind. Emacs
and Org Roam provides the best experience in navigating through the notes in this repository,
although I'm also planning to make them accessible using a web interface.
