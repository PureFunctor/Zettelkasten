* Pure's Zettelkasten
This repository houses zettelkasten notes that I've composed using [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org Roam]]. I mostly write about
functional programming concepts as well as [[https://purescript.org][PureScript]]. Currently, Emacs and [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org Roam]] provides the
best possible experience in navigating through the notes in this repository, however, I'm planning
to eventually publish them online for easier access.
