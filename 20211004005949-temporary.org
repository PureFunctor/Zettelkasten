* Oxide Bar
~oxide-bar~ is my personal =lemonbar= configuration program that aims to
replace my current =polybar= setup.

** Notes
+ Allow color configuration for each section. We can use some data type
  for this to parse hex representations. We also simply need to add the
  fields to the structs instead of doing anything fancy.
+ Move sections into their own modules under ~oxide~. This should allow
  development to feel less cluttered.
